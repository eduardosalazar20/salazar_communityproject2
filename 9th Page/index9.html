        Here, a community gathered on Sundays, and in between
         A place of certainty and comfort in a world not solid
        A source of faith, often tested and affirmed.
        Here, children dangled their legs from wooden pers
        Wondering when playtime would come again
        Trading glances with other children dressed in Sunday best.
        Here, women grew friendships for a lifetime Over quilting bees, 
        Bible studies and bake sales While men huddled in conversation on the lawn.
        Here, couples vowed to love one another til death
        Promising to lean on one another in times of challenge
        And celebrate together in times of joy.
        Here, parents brought their babies to be blessed
        Pledging to return to this place of faith and community
        Joining a family larger than their own.
        Here, families said goodbye to their beloved
        Remembering the way they spoke or laughed or loved the ocean
        Wishing them well on their journey after life.
        Here, time passed, doors opening and closing
        One generation slipping into another
        Fewer footsteps on this wooden floor, then none.
        Here, two see a home built out of love
        A way to honour what has been and what will be A
        space that they can make their own and share.
        Here, neighbours come to see the place They knew back when and know again
        Sharing tea and stories through the hours.
        Here, friends meet over food and drink
        A place to laugh and talk - no thought of time
        Leaning into comfort, finding home.
