# project review:

In this project we are tasked to research a poem or song that represents what community means to us. The poem that I'll be doing is a Church Poem. The poem goes like this "Here, a community gathered on Sundays, and in between A place of certainty and comfort in a world not solid, A source of faith, often tested and affirmed. Here, children dangled their legs from wooden pews. Wondering when playtime would come again. Trading glances with other children dressed in Sunday best. Here, women grew friendships for a lifetime Over quilting bees, Bible studies and bake sales While men huddled in conversation on the lawn. Here, couples vowed to love one another til death, Promising to lean on one another in times of challenge. And celebrate together in times of joy. Here, parents brought their babies to be blessed. Pledging to return to this place of faith and community. Joining a family larger than their own." Choosing this text for project 2, is a representation of what community means to me in the church. For me the church was a community that I felt welcomed in. Growing up in the church made me realize a lot about life and what it is about being part of a religion. The church has guided me to become a better person and it was a supportive community, not only for me but for my family and others as well. Another key part of this is it helps me relieve from any problems, stress or time to think. Without this community I think I would be lost in life and maybe be lost on what I want to do with my life. Due to school and work I'm not able to attend the church as much as I used to but I hope sometime in the near future I can make up some time to get back into attending my community. The words that I will be choosing to animate will be important words that speak to me when reading this poem. These are words that give me a sense of what the poem is trying to convey and how I think those words should act if they were to have a sense of life. The poem was shorten in order to focus on the important aspect of what community means to me. 

# technical overview:

A 85% of this project is still in progress. The software that was used to create this project was visual studio code. 9 htmls and 1 css were created each having their own folder to be organized. The layout of this project is to have the user interact with the text and take you to another page. The text that is choosen is " Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif ". The font was chosen in order to have a corrolation to font that is use in bibles and religion which is mainly serifs. An Id class was set to group the which is called at "PoemIntro". Specifications were set "display: flex, flex-direction: row,  align-items: center; width: 100%; height: 100vh; background-color: white, color: #36bbf9 ,font-size: 25px, font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif.


Each word had their own id or class. For the first page, the text that are set for animation were " community, gathered, place, certainly, comfort and solid". Community and gathered animations are set to go up and unite as part of what it represents. To this keyframes were set scale and translate for both using a negative and postive numhers to set their postition. Place used keyframes: scale, translate, translate in order to have the word go up and hover certainly and comfort. Solid has a div class with a nav, a tag, in order to target to the next html 2. 

Index 2 text animations are "faith, dangled their legs and pews". Faith is using an id in order to have text to scale and as way to represent of something growth of believing. Tranform scale 1- 3 was set. Dangled legs used a class in order to have a hover effect. It was set as legs1:hover with a rotate. The animation is supposed to signfy what I interpert these texts. Pews does not have an animation yet but has nav and a tag link to connect to hmtl 3

Index 3 text animations are "playtime and best". Play has a hover effect using a class. Playtimes animation was spinning 9000deg in order to represent something moving as connects to children. Its set was playTime1:hover utransform: rotate(9000deg). Best has no animation as it still being worked on. 

Index 4 text animations are "grew friendships and sales". Grew friendships has an id of "womenFriendship" in order to have animation set. This the represent the growth of something making it going up. It has the setup of keyframes womenFriendship: transform: scale(1) to transform: scale(3) and translate(0px,-50px). sales is not yet animated but it still in the process. The nav and a tag was applied to the word connecting to html 5.

Index 5 text animations are "men, huddled and till death". Men and huddle had an id of the same name. Keyframes for men was set to menMove from transform:200px,10px to transform: rotate(-30deg) translate(20px, 0px), in order to have the text move in to the other text huddled. For huddled the keyframe was set huddledMove from transform:200px,10px, to transform: rotate(30deg)translate(-20px, 0px). This has the same animation as men but going towards to men text. This animation gives life to both words showing a represention of what two words mean how I interepert it. The till death animation has class set in order to get the animation to go down representing death as death usually means something going towards the ground. It has a nav and a tag linking to html 6. 
    

Index 6 text animations are "lean, challange, celebrate and in times of joy". 

Index 7 text animations are "babies and blessed". 

Index 8 text animations are "faith and community"

Index 9 text animations are "joining a family larger than their own"
