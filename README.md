# project review:

In this project we are tasked to research a poem or song that represent to what community meas to us. The poem that I'll be doing, is a Church Poem. The poem goes like this "Here, a community gathered on Sundays, and in between A place of certainty and comfort in a world not solid, A source of faith, often tested and affirmed. Here, children dangled their legs from wooden pews. Wondering when playtime would come again. Trading glances with other children dressed in Sunday best. Here, women grew friendships for a lifetime Over quilting bees, Bible studies and bake sales While men huddled in conversation on the lawn. Here, couples vowed to love one another til death, Promising to lean on one another in times of challenge. And celebrate together in times of joy. Here, parents brought their babies to be blessed. Pledging to return to this place of faith and community. Joining a family larger than their own." Choosing this text for project 2, is a represention what community means to me in the church.
