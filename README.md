# project review:

In this project we are tasked to research a poem or song that represents what community means to us. The poem that I'll be doing is a Church Poem. The poem goes like this "Here, a community gathered on Sundays, and in between A place of certainty and comfort in a world not solid, A source of faith, often tested and affirmed. Here, children dangled their legs from wooden pews. Wondering when playtime would come again. Trading glances with other children dressed in Sunday best. Here, women grew friendships for a lifetime Over quilting bees, Bible studies and bake sales While men huddled in conversation on the lawn. Here, couples vowed to love one another til death, Promising to lean on one another in times of challenge. And celebrate together in times of joy. Here, parents brought their babies to be blessed. Pledging to return to this place of faith and community. Joining a family larger than their own." Choosing this text for project 2, is a representation of what community means to me in the church. For me the church was a community that I felt welcomed in. Growing up in the church made me realize a lot about life and what it is about being part of a religion. The church has guided me to become a better person and it was a supportive community, not only for me but for my family and others as well. Another key part of this is it helps me relieve from any problems, stress or time to think. Without this community I think I would be lost in life and maybe be lost on what I want to do with my life. Due to school and work I'm not able to attend the church as much as I used to but I hope sometime in the near future I can make up some time to get back into attending my community. The words that I will be choosing to animate will be important words that speak to me when reading this poem. These are words that give me a sense of what the poem is trying to convey and how I think those words should act if they were to have a sense of life.
